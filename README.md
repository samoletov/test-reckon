# NodeJs Pre-Interview Coding Test

Welcome to the Reckon coding test!
Build the code as if this was just one of many tasks that you have to do in one day, using whatever libraries / frameworks you feel comfortable with unless explicitly instructed not to. The tasks are fairly straightforward and should take no longer than an hour, there are no major "gotchas" but there will be input and output that exist beyond the samples provided. When finished, please create a repository and push the unzipped, raw source to a public bitbucket / github repository and then submit a link to this repository. Please submit working nodeJs source code to solve the problem along with any supporting code that you might have used in testing.
